These scripts show examples of the use of my
[python_freetype](https://github.com/ldo/python_freetype) module. You
will need to have that installed before you can run these. The
examples are:

* code_coverage -- show the character code coverage of a font
* font_chart -- generate a chart of all characters in a font (also needs Qahirah)
* render_text -- simple renderer of a line of text (also needs Qahirah)

The file code_blocks.py contains some common Unicode definitions
needed by a couple of the scripts.

See the header comments in each script for more details.
