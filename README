These scripts show examples of the use of my
[python_freetype](https://github.com/ldo/python_freetype) module. You
will need to have that installed before you can run these. The
examples are:

* code_coverage -- show the character code coverage of a font
* render_text -- simple renderer of a line of text (also needs Pycairo)

See the header comments in each script for more details.
